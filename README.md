## hypermodern python

### part 01

installed pyenv, not sure I like/need it with virtualenv, can always type full pathname to executable and activate venv, which appropriately sets paths
also, pyenv-win at least wants to install python for you to a userdir, rather than working with already-installed pythons
it's a fine system, if you have different preferences
